Q2: Is Evernote a Software Product Line or Software as a Service?

Answer:

Evernote is mainly a Software as a Service (SaaS). 
It means you use the internet to access Evernote rather than setting up and updating software on your own devices. 

It provides tools for note-taking, archiving, organizing, and task management that you can use on many platforms
like desktop applications, mobile apps and web browsers.
This flexibility allows you to easily access your data from any device connected with internet. 


However, Evernote also has some characteristics of a Software Product Line (SPL). A collection of connected software products serving various purposes is called an SPL.

A software product line consists of a group of linked products that are constructed from a common set of core assets and are intended to meet the needs of various user segments or market needs.

In Conclusion, Evernote fits the SaaS model but it also has elements of a Software Product Line due to its range of customized programs.
