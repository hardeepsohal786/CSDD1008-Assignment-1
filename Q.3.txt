Sarah, the pupil

She is able to quickly search for information using keywords and arrange things into notebooks. Sarah can easily collaborate on projects with her classmates and share her notes with them thanks to Evernote's collaboration tools.

David, the Businessman:
David is a 35-year-old businessman who owns and operates a digital marketing agency. He works from a busy downtown home office.

Challenges: David has a busy schedule and finds it difficult to maintain organization. He frequently loses sight of project deadlines and forgets crucial information from customer meetings. It's also difficult for him to instantly communicate essential facts to his colleagues.
How Evernote Helps: David uses Evernote as his digital workspace, which enables him to annotate voice memos, text messages, and photographs from any location.
